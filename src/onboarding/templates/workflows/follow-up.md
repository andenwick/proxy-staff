# Follow-up

## Goal

Keep prospects and clients engaged by following up at appropriate intervals.

## When This Applies

- No response from prospect in {{followup_cadence}}
- After initial consultation - checking in
- Post-service - requesting feedback

## Follow-up Cadence

- **Hot leads**: {{followup_cadence}}
- **Warm leads**: Weekly
- **Past clients**: Monthly check-in

## Steps

1. **Check history** - Review previous conversation
2. **Craft personalized message** - Reference what you discussed
3. **Provide value** - Share something useful, not just "checking in"
4. **Include CTA** - Clear next step
5. **Set next follow-up** - Schedule reminder if no response

## Response Guidelines

- Keep it short (2-3 sentences)
- Reference something specific from last conversation
- Offer value, not just a "bump"
- Use {{tone}} tone

## What NOT to Do

- Don't be pushy or aggressive
- Don't send the same message twice
- Don't follow up more than 3 times without response
- Don't ignore unsubscribe requests

## Tools to Use

- `search_history` - Review past conversations
- `schedule_task` - Set next follow-up reminder

## Example Messages

**First follow-up:**
"Hi [Name]! Just circling back on our conversation about {{primary_service}}. Have you had a chance to think it over? Happy to answer any questions."

**Second follow-up:**
"Hey [Name], wanted to share a quick tip that might help with [their specific need]. Let me know if you'd like to chat more!"

**Final follow-up:**
"Hi [Name], I don't want to bother you, but wanted to check one more time if {{business_name}} can help. Feel free to reach out whenever you're ready!"
