# Your AI Assistant - Quick Start Guide

Welcome! Your AI assistant is ready to help you manage communications, tasks, and day-to-day business operations.

## Getting Started

### First Message
Just send a message to start chatting. Your assistant will:
1. Introduce itself
2. Ask a few questions to understand your business
3. Start helping right away

### What Your Assistant Can Do
- Answer questions about your business
- Draft and send emails
- Manage your calendar
- Research contacts and companies
- Schedule follow-ups
- Keep notes and remember important details

---

## How to Communicate

### Keep It Natural
Talk to your assistant like you would a capable employee. Be clear and direct.

**Good:**
> "Send a follow-up email to John about our meeting next week"

**Also Good:**
> "What meetings do I have tomorrow?"

### Be Specific When Needed
If a task has specific requirements, include them:
> "Draft an email to Sarah - keep it brief, mention the project deadline is Friday"

### Ask Questions
Your assistant will ask clarifying questions if something is unclear. This is normal and helps ensure the right action is taken.

## Useful Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/reset` | Start fresh (clears current conversation) |
| `/new` | Same as /reset |
| `/cancel` | Stop a task that's taking too long |

## Training Your Assistant

### Teaching Preferences
When you tell your assistant something about how you work, it remembers:
- "I prefer emails to be brief"
- "Never schedule meetings before 10am"
- "Always CC my assistant on client emails"

### Correcting Mistakes
If your assistant does something wrong, just tell it:
- "That's too formal, make it more casual"
- "Don't include pricing in initial emails"

It learns from these corrections.

### Building Knowledge
Share information about your business as it comes up:
- Key clients and contacts
- Services and pricing
- Common questions you get asked
- How you like things done

---

## What Your Assistant Won't Do

For your protection, your assistant will:
- **Never** commit to prices without your approval
- **Never** share confidential information
- **Never** send external messages without confirmation (unless you've pre-approved)
- **Always** ask if something seems unclear or risky

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start simple** - Begin with basic tasks, then try more complex ones
2. **Give feedback** - Tell it when something works well or needs improvement
3. **Be patient during learning** - The first week it's gathering information
4. **Use it daily** - Regular use helps it learn your patterns faster

## Common Questions

### "Why does it ask so many questions?"
In the first few days, your assistant is learning about your business. This is normal and helps it serve you better long-term.

### "Can it access my email/calendar?"
Yes, if those integrations have been set up. Ask your ProxyStaff contact if you're unsure what's connected.

### "Is my data secure?"
Yes. Your data is encrypted and isolated. Your assistant only sees information related to your business.

### "What if it makes a mistake?"
Just tell it! Say "that's not right" or "don't do that again" and it will learn. For urgent issues, contact your ProxyStaff support.
